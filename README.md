# Challenge-Response Authentication Mechanism (CRAM) Simulation
This project simulates the Challenge-Response Authentication Mechanism (CRAM) using biometric authentication in Android application.  
The backend is built with C# using .NET Framework.

### Tech Stack

**Frontend (Android):**
- Kotlin
- Jetpack Compose
- Biometric API
- Retrofit & OkHttp


**Backend:**
- C#
- .NET Framework
- Entity Framework

## Introduction
The idea for this project came from a random thought I had when I was assigned a task to implement biometric authentication. 
The question was: Is it possible to log in using biometrics securely without revoking or refreshing tokens? And can biometrics replace username-password authentication to simplify the login process? The answer is—yes, it’s possible. But is it secure? That’s what I wanted to explore. 
So, I elaborated on my idea using the Challenge-Response Authentication Mechanism (CRAM). As a starting point, I built a simple backend API using C# and .NET, which includes basic login functionality and an endpoint to simulate the challenge-response mechanism.
